# Restaurant Billing System Project Report

## Title
Development of a Console-Based Restaurant Billing System using C Programming Language

## Objective
To develop a user-friendly, efficient, and reliable restaurant billing system that can handle food orders, manage quantities, calculate bills, and provide a seamless ordering experience for both customers and restaurant staff.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stems from the need to:
- Automate the manual billing process in restaurants
- Reduce human errors in order taking and bill calculation
- Provide a structured and organized way to manage food orders
- Create a system that can be easily modified and extended for different types of restaurants

## Concept
The Restaurant Billing System is a console-based application that implements the following key concepts:
- Modular programming using functions
- Array data structures for managing menu items and quantities
- Pointer manipulation for bill calculation
- User input validation and error handling
- Interactive menu system with multiple options

## Problem Statement
Traditional restaurant billing systems often face challenges such as:
- Manual calculation errors
- Time-consuming order processing
- Difficulty in managing multiple orders
- Lack of flexibility in modifying orders
- Inefficient tracking of order quantities

This project aims to address these issues by providing an automated, error-free, and efficient billing system.
